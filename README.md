How to run code:
   - compile and run index.java


Notes at 5:05pm EST - I plan on first doing an attempt just with an array values
                      before then using cell objects.

Notes at 6:42 EST - I have successfully set up the file to run for a 10x10 grid.
                    Now, I will create cell objects to replace the index and
                    make this object-oriented.
