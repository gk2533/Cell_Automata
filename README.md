# Cell Automata - Gabriel Klass

How to run code:
   - compile and run index.java. I do this by "javac index.java", and
     then "java index"
   - to change tests (currently in TestCase1): First, go to index.java and
                                               change the neighborhood size to
                                               fit your test. Next, go to
                                               index.java, scroll down to line
                                               149, and replace the pre-set
                                               setValues() with your grid.

                                               **Note: use (x-1, y-1) to set
                                                       values
