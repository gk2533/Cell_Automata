How to run code:
   - compile and run index.java. I do this by "javac index.java", and
     then "java index"
   - to change tests (currently in TestCase1): First, go to index.java and
                                               change the neighborhood size to
                                               fit your test (). next, go to
                                               index.java, scroll down to line
                                               149, and replace the pre-set
                                               setValues() with your grid.

                                               **Note: use (x-1, y-1) to set
                                                       alues


Notes at 5:05pm EST - I plan on first doing an attempt just with an array values
                      before then using cell objects.

Notes at 6:42pm EST - I have successfully set up the file to run for a 10x10 grid.
                      Now, I will create cell objects to replace the index and
                      make this object-oriented.

Notes at 7:15pm EST - I created Cell.java and update index.java to incorporate
                      objects.
